      q: 'Why?',
      a: [
        'We first got chickens because there are six of us and we eat a lot of eggs. We decided to expand the flock as a way to teach our kids. So far we have touched on math, biology, physics, budgeting, marketing, economics, coding, product development, branding, cooperative decision-making, project management, and of course, responsibility.',
        "Caleb says he is in it to save for a car and Hudson is saving for a house. We haven't gotten to the math lesson where they learn it will take about half a million eggs to reach those goals.",

    },
    {
      q: 'How did you get your name?',
      a: [
        "Well we thought long and hard for a good punny name, but ultimately went with True North because our youngest daughter was singing (yelling) the song True North so loudly that we couldn't really think of anything else. It also fits nicely with our registered home school name - Compass Academy - as well as our general purpose in doing all of this - to raise kids with a good sense of direction.",
      ],
    },
    {
      q: 'Where and how can we purchase the eggs?',
      a: [
        "We sell from two locations - our home in Mint Hill and at Ben's office near uptown Charlotte. Reach out to us through the contact form and we will get in touch with you to coordinate.",

    {
      q: 'How many chickens do you have?',
      a: [
        'All together, we have 45 ladies. 13 of them have been providing our family eggs and Caleb and Hudson have 32 that they are raising.',

    { q: 'Can we visit the chickens?', a: ["I don't see why not."] },
    {
      q: 'What are those spots in my farm-fresh eggs?',
      a: [
        'Those brownish or reddish specks you\'ll occasionally find floating in your farm-fresh eggs are called "meat spots" or "blood spots. These spots are not a cause for concern. Eggs found in the grocery store have been "candled" to check the inside for any defects. This is why you rarely come across a meat spot in a store-bought egg. The spots do not mean that the egg has been fertilized. They are a result of a malfunction on the part of the hen - caused by the rupture of a blood vessel on the yolk surface when it\'s being formed. If you find one you can either dig it out or make a wish and ignore it."',
      ],
    },
    {
      q: 'Do my eggs need to be refrigerated? How long do they last?',
      a: [
        'Just before laying an egg, a protective layer called "bloom" or cuticle is added to the outside of an egg. Unwashed eggs will last about 3 weeks unrefrigerated or up to three months if refrigerated. The eggs can be washed with warm water, but this removes the protective layer. It is important to wash with warm water because cold water can push bacteria into the shell pores. If washed, the eggs should be kept refrigerated and will last at least two months, but may not taste as fresh as an unwashed egg of the same age.',

    {
      q: 'What is the difference between brown and white eggs?',
      a: [
        'Egg color depends entirely on the breed of chicken. There is no nutritional, quality or flavor difference. Our girls are all the same breed and lay brown eggs.',
      ],
    },
    {
      q: 'What kind of chickens do you have?',
      a: [
        'All of our chickens are a breed called "Golden Comets". They are a mix between Rhode Island Reds (great layers) and White Leghorn (friendly and easy-going), which makes for a nice mix.',
      ],
    },
    {
      q: 'Will my eggs start chirping?',
      a: [
        'They will not. We do not have a rooster and it is biologically impossible for procreation to happen with chickens without a male and female - science.',
      ],
    },
    {
      q: 'How big are the eggs?',
      a: [
        'Our eggs are sold as ungraded eggs, which means they are not officially sized. There are variations in the eggs because they are fresh from the chickens and are not culled in a chicken factory, but most of them would fall into the large category if they were graded.',
